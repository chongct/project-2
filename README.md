### User Stories

* As a user without a registered account, I want to be able to perform searches so that I can decide if I should sign up for an account.
* As a user without a registered account, I also want to be able to have my results analyzed so that I can decide if I should sign up for an account.
* As a user with a registered account, in addition to the benefits a user without a registered account is able to enjoy, I want to be able to save my search results and analyzed results so that I can refer to them in the future.
